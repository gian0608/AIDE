- Working with virtual environments for project isolation.
- Basic usage of package managers like pip.

**2. Python Basics: Syntax and Variables:**

**Print Statements and Comments:**
```python
# Basic print statement
print("Hello, Python!")

# Comments for code explanation
# This is a single-line comment
```

**Variables and Data Types:**
```python
# Variable assignment
name = "John"
age = 25

# Data types: str, int, float
```

**Operators and Expressions:**
```python
# Arithmetic operators
result = 10 + 5 * 2

# Comparison operators
is_equal = (a == b)
```

**3. Control Flow: Conditional Statements and Loops:**

**If, elif, and else Statements:**
```python
# Basic if-else statement
if condition:
    # Code block executed if the condition is true
else:
    # Code block executed if the condition is false
```

**While and For Loops:**
```python
# While loop
while condition:
    # Code block executed as long as the condition is true

# For loop
for item in iterable:
    # Code block executed for each item in the iterable
```

**Break and Continue Statements:**
```python
# Break statement
for item in iterable:
    if condition:
        break  # Exit the loop prematurely

# Continue statement
for item in iterable:
    if condition:
        continue  # Skip the rest of the loop and move to the next iteration
```

**4. Data Structures in Python:**

**Lists, Tuples, and Sets:**
```python
# Lists
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Tuples
my_tuple = (4, 5, 6)

# Sets
my_set = {7, 8, 9}
```

**Dictionaries and Their Usage:**
```python
# Dictionary
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}

# Accessing values and dictionary methods
```

**List Comprehensions:**
```python
# List comprehension to create a new list
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
```

**5. Functions in Python:**

**Defining Functions:**
```python
# Function definition
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

**Parameters and Return Values:**
```python
# Function with parameters and a return value
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**Scope and Lifetime of Variables:**
```python
# Global and local scope
global_variable = 10

def my_function():
    local_variable = 5
    return global_variable + local_variable
```

**6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python:**

**Classes and Objects:**
```python
# Class definition
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

**Inheritance and Polymorphism:**
```python
# Inheritance
class Cat(Dog):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"
```

**Encapsulation and Abstraction:**
```python
# Encapsulation using private attributes
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.__radius = radius

    def get_radius(self):
        return self.__radius
```

**7. File Handling in Python:**

**Reading and Writing Text Files:**
```python
# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()

# Writing to a file
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!")
```

**Working with CSV and JSON Files:**
```python
# CSV file handling
import csv

with open("data.csv", "r") as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)
```

**Exception Handling:**
```python
# Handling exceptions
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

**8. Python Modules and Libraries:**

**Introduction to Modules:**
```python
# Importing modules
import math

# Using module functions
result = math.sqrt(25)
```

**Exploring Common Libraries (e.g., math, random):**
```python
# Random number generation
import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
```

**Installing and Using External Libraries (e.g., requests):**
```python
#

 Installing external libraries
# pip install requests

# Using requests library for HTTP requests
import requests

response = requests.get("https://www.example.com")
```

**9. Introduction to Web Development with Flask:**

**Setting Up a Flask Project:**
```python
# Installing Flask
# pip install Flask

# Creating a simple Flask app
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"
```

**Routes and Views:**
```python
# Adding multiple routes
@app.route("/about")
def about():
    return "About Page"
```

**HTML Templates and Forms:**
```python
# Rendering HTML templates
from flask import render_template

@app.route("/profile/<username>")
def profile(username):
    return render_template("profile.html", username=username)
```

**10. Advanced Topics: Multithreading and Multiprocessing:**

**Understanding Threads and Processes:**
```python
# Multithreading example
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

# Create and start a thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread.start()
```

**Threading vs. Multiprocessing:**
```python
# Multiprocessing example
from multiprocessing import Process

def print_letters():
    for letter in "ABCDE":
        print(letter)

# Create and start a process
process = Process(target=print_letters)
process.start()
```

**Practical Examples:**
```python
# Solving a problem using multithreading or multiprocessing
# ...

# Comparing performance and efficiency
# ...
```
